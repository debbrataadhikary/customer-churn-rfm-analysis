# 🚀 Executive Customer Insights & RFM-Driven Retention Strategy

## 🌟 Project Goal & Overview

This project delivers an **Advanced Business Intelligence solution** designed to analyze customer behavior and optimize revenue retention for a large-scale E-commerce dataset. By transitioning from a simple reporting tool to a **Strategic Decision Support System**, this project focuses on:

1.  **Behavioral Segmentation:** Implementing an advanced **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model to decode customer loyalty.
2.  **Revenue Risk Assessment:** Quantifying the financial impact of churn, identifying **$1.04M in lost revenue**.
3.  **Executive Visualization:** A high-contrast, dark-themed dashboard designed for C-suite executives to monitor **8.91M in total revenue** and 19K orders at a glance.

### 🔑 Strategic Technologies & Workflow

| Category | Tools Used | Role in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Engineering** | SQL (Behavioral Logic) | Transformed raw transactions into 11 specialized tables focusing on customer life-cycles. |
| **Data Modeling** | Power BI Star Schema | Optimized data relationships for lightning-fast cross-filtering. |
| **Business Logic** | Advanced DAX | Calculated high-impact metrics like **LTV ($2.05K)** and **AOV ($480.76)**. |

## 🔬 Technical Depth: SQL-Driven Behavioral Architecture

The core of this analysis lies in the **SQL Pre-processing Layer**. We intentionally avoided general geography to focus strictly on **Customer Purchasing Habits**. 11 sequential SQL scripts were used to build a robust behavioral foundation:

| SQL Module | Business Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `churn_check.sql` | Defined 'Active' vs 'Churned' status based on transaction gaps. |
| `revenue_impact_by_churn.sql` | Isolated the **$1.04M Churned Revenue** for targeted win-back analysis. |
| `rfm_base_table.sql` | Aggregated R, F, M scores to build the 5-tier segmentation model. |
